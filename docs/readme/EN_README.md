## 📖 Introduction

This is an **AI-driven open-world cultivation simulator**.

Unlike traditional RPGs where you play a specific character, here **you play as the "Heavenly Dao" (God)**.
You don't need to personally fight monsters or level up. Instead, you observe all living beings from a god's perspective. In an open world woven together by rules and AI, you witness the rise and fall of sects and the emergence of prodigies. You can quietly watch the world change, or bring down tribulations and alter minds, subtly intervening in the world's progress.

### ✨ Core Highlights

- 👁️ **Play as "Heavenly Dao" (God Perspective)**: You are not a cultivator, but the **Heavenly Dao** controlling the world's rules. Observe the myriad forms of life and experience their joys and sorrows.
- 🤖 **Fully AI-Driven**: Every NPC is independently driven by LLMs, with unique personalities, memories, relationships, and behavioral logic. They make decisions based on the current situation, have love and hate, form factions, and even defy the heavens to change their fate.
- 🌏 **Rules as the Cornerstone**: The world runs on a rigorous numerical system including spiritual roots, realms, cultivation methods, and lifespans. AI imagination is constrained within a reasonable cultivation logic framework, ensuring the world is authentic and credible.
- 🦋 **Emergent Storytelling**: Even the developer doesn't know what will happen next. There is no preset script, only world evolution woven from countless causes and effects. Sect wars, righteous vs. demonic conflicts, the fall of geniuses—all are deduced autonomously by the world's logic.

### 💭 Why make this?
The worlds in cultivation novels are fascinating, but readers can only ever observe a corner of them.

Cultivation games are either completely scripted or rely on simple state machines designed by humans, often resulting in forced and unintelligent behaviors.

With the advent of Large Language Models, the goal of making "every character alive" seems reachable.

I hope to create a pure, joyful, direct, and living sense of immersion in a cultivation world. Not a pure marketing tool for some game company, nor pure research like Stanford Town, but an actual world that provides players with real immersion.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker One-Click Deployment (Recommended)

No environment configuration needed, just run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AI-Cultivation/cultivation-world-simulator.git
cd cultivation-world-simulator
docker-compose up -d --build
```

Access Address: Frontend `http://localhost:8123` | Backend `http://localhost:8002`

### Option 2: Source Code Deployment (Development Mode)

Suitable for developers who need to modify code or debug.

1. **Environment Setup & Start**
   ```bash
   # 1. Install backend dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   # 2. Install frontend dependencies (Node.js required)
   cd web && npm install && cd ..

   # 3. Start service (Automatically pulls up frontend and backend)
   python src/server/main.py --dev
   ```

2. **Model Configuration**
   The browser will open automatically after the service starts. **It is recommended to directly select presets (e.g., DeepSeek/Ollama) on the frontend settings page**, or manually modify `static/local_config.yml`.
