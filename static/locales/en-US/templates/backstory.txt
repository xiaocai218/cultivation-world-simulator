{world_info}

Requirements:

2. Be concise and clear, around 30-40 words.
3. Similar to: "Once the wealthiest merchant's daughter in Shazhou City, kidnapped by villains at fifteen and forced to practice demonic arts." or "Originally a cowherd boy, yearning for immortality after witnessing immortals fighting, sought immortal fate for ten years before finally entering a sect."
4. Must fit the style of the Xianxia world and the character's current traits (e.g., spiritual root, personality, sect, alignment).
5. It can be complex and ever-changing, or plain and ordinary.
6. If the parents or relatives are also cultivators, it should be reflected in the backstory.
