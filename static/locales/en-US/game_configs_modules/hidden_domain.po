"The site where a human mighty figure perished together with the Flame Demon "
"Emperor ten thousand years ago. To this day, the earth veins still spew "
"unextinguishable Earthly Baleful Fire, dyeing the sky blood-red. Buried "
"beneath the scorched earth are countless broken swords and halberds, and at "
"midnight, battle souls roar, reenacting the tragic slaughter of the past. "
"Training here requires enduring the constant pain of fire poison eroding the"
" heart, but it is excellent for comprehending ancient battle intent. Those "
"with deep destiny might even pick up fragment artifacts left by ancient "
"cultivators from the magma depths or glimpse a trace of the Great Dao."

"A magnificent complex of palaces floating above the Nine Heavens Wind Layer."
" Only those with great perseverance can pass through the spatial rifts on "
"the periphery that tear at the flesh. The interior is filled with ancient "
"restrictions and layered illusion arrays; one wrong step means body and soul"
" destruction, lost forever in the void. Although the Scripture Pavilion has "
"collapsed over time, every page of the golden books and jade scrolls "
"scattering in the void turbulence records supreme supernatural powers "
"capable of causing a bloodbath in the cultivation world. Only peak Core "
"Formation cultivators can barely withstand the pressure from the ancient "
"times to spy a glimpse of immortal opportunity."

"A fragment of the ancient Azure Emperor's Garden that shattered eons ago, "
"now perpetually shrouded in multicolored, toxic miasma. The broken laws "
"within cause spirit plants to grow madly, with shapeshifting demon vines and"
" man-eating flowers lurking in the shadows. Rumor has it that if one can "
"traverse the outer \"Dead Silence Forest\" and find the \"Azure Wood Spirit "
"Spring\" at the core, even mortal grass can become immortal medicine. "
"However, one must beware of the guardian beasts, twisted by millennia of "
"consuming medicinal dregs, who thirst for fresh blood."
