    "q1_content": "API (Application Programming Interface) is like a 'phone line'. This game itself doesn't have thinking capabilities; it connects to a remote AI 'brain' (like Qwen or DeepSeek servers) through this line. When the game settles monthly and decides NPC actions, it sends relevant information through the API to the AI, which thinks and returns the result.",
